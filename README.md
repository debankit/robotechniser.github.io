# Repository for RoboTech Club's Website

## Assets Required:

1. Summaries of Project Details
2. Full blogs for Projects
3. Project Images
4. Edited Project Videos, uploaded to RTC's YouTube
5. Member Images
6. Member Social Links - Mail | GitHub | FB | Insta | Twitter (SNS Optional)
7. A "Join Us" Google Form

## Things left to do:

1. Add a blog template
2. Pop-out project details - project images specifically
3. Link to a "Join Us" Google Form

## Issues:

1. Android Chrome does not support backDropFilter yet. All affected tiles show up translucent, with no blur.
2. .connect tile (height set to auto, at the moment) dwarfens the tile (obviously) - Maybe, after we add the GForm, we can do something.
