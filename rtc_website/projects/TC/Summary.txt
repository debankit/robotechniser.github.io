We've made a miniature tesla coil(slayer exciter circuit) with a secondary coil of 400 turns that can output 1200 volts. It can be used to light up flourocent bulbs in close proximity and can transmit wirless electricity (around 5 volts) to small circuits too.

FUTURE PROSPECTS:

In future we plan to make a bigger version of this circuit with more turns in secondary coil (possibly 1000 turns) and  with a new circuit that can handle more power with power MOSFET drivers, we can output more than 5000 volts and can get decent visible arcs.
          With this new tesla coil, we can understand wireless power transmission in a more illustrative way. Seeing a CFL light up wirelessly, makes it an attractive  project and people will surely be interested to know the science behind it.
